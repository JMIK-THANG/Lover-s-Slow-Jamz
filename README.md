## General Requirements

1. Your project must be located in an open GitHub repository
2. We recommend deploying your project (use GitHub Pages or Netlify for deploying your front end application), but if you don't have time, insert instructions to [README.md](http://readme.md) in the repo on how to run the projects locally
3. You're not allowed to copy code or ready projects from GitHub, but you can use external libraries
4. At the end of the Code Jam, each team sends a link to the repo to Andrei Parfenov in Discord
5. The presentation can add up to 25 points to the project
6. The winners will receive prizes and certificates from TripleTen!
7. All the participants will receive prizes and there will be special audience award prizes for the winning team in this category!

During the Code Jam, you should create a **front-end part of the web application/ MVP project**. Choose one of the ideas we prepared (in the **Ideas section**) or your own. If you feel like you have enough power and skill, you can try building the backend logic. 

You're not limited in technologies. You can use different frameworks and libraries. It might be a vanilla JS or React app. Feel free to connect external APIs and modules.
